# Audio_Player
This is a music player interface where a user can play, pause, skip, rewind, and scrub through a song.

This was a fun project for me. I remember back in the day, I used to use a program on my computer called WinAmp to listen to music. This took me back to those days, creating a music player.
I don't know how useful this is today, with things like Spotify or Pandora.
